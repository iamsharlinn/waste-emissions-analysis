# 📊 U.S. Waste Facility Emissions – EPA GHG Analysis (2023)

This project analyzes **greenhouse gas emissions** from U.S. waste facilities using the **EPA's 2023 GHGRP dataset**. The goal is to identify top CO₂e emitters, understand state-by-state trends, and explore how methane capture could significantly reduce climate impact.

---

## 🔍 Project Objective

To explore real-world CO₂e emissions from municipal waste facilities and visualize:
- Top 10 highest-emitting facilities
- State-level emission distribution
- Emissions reduction scenario (75% methane capture)
- Geospatial map of emission hot spots

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python (Spyder via Anaconda)**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** for charting
- **Folium** for interactive geospatial mapping
- **EPA GHGRP dataset (2023)**

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- The top 10 waste facilities emit **hundreds of thousands of metric tons** of CO₂e annually.
- **New York and Massachusetts** lead in landfill-related emissions among reported states.
- A 75% methane capture efficiency could reduce emissions by over **1.2 million metric tons**.
- Facility-level mapping reveals high-impact zones for potential climate intervention.
